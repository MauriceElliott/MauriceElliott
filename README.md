الحرية لفلسطين 🇵🇸 ###

### Hello, I'm Maurice Elliott

I'm a software engineer, work in DevOps but follow all and every project I find mild interest in.
I'm currently a busy father but try my best to spend a few evenings a week working on personal projects.
My favourite language at the moment is Swift so most new projects will be using that with varying degrees of success.
